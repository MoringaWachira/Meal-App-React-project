      <h1>Recipe Development & Testing</h1>
      <p>We believe in a diet that includes a wide variety of foods:
         real butter and cream, extra virgin olive oil, eggs, lots of fruits and vegetables,<br></br> and protein from meat, fish, beans, and cheese.
         Plus cake for dessert.<br></br>There are three things we think about when deciding if a recommendation is good enough to go on Simply Recipes.We check if it is affordable,delicious and worth the effort.
